***this*** is an important topic for JavaScript developers. So what is this😅??

this is a special keyword that is created for every <Highlight>execution context</Highlight>.I will cover execution context,call stack,memory heap in my future posts.


this is not static i.e it changes depending upon the place where it is used.In most cases,value of this is determined by how function is called.

# Global context

In the global execution context i.e outside of any function this refers to global object which is window in case of browsers.

```js
console.log(this) //Window
this === window //true
```

# Inside Method

In a method, this keyword refers to the object it belongs to ,which means using this keyword we can able to ***access its properties*** inside an object.

```js
const profile = {
    name: 'charan',
    favLang: 'js',
    printUser: function(){
        console.log(`${this.name} ${this.favLang}`);
    }
}
profile.printUser();  // charan js
```

# Simple Function Call

this in a function refers to <Highlight>global object Window</Highlight> but in strict mode this keyword refers to <Highlight>undefined</Highlight>.


Strict mode: In order to use strict mode we use an expression: *“use strict”*.It helps to write cleaner code,like preventing from using undeclared variable.

```js
function testThis(){
    console.log(this);
}
testThis()   // Window

“use strict"
function testThis(){
    console.log(this);
}
// undefined
```

# Event Listener

Here this refers to DOM element that handler is attached to.In simple words it refers to HTML element that received the event.

# Arrow Function

Arrow function doesn’t get its own this.It uses *lexical* i.e it uses parent scope of this.

```js
const ex=()=>{
    console.log(this);
}

ex(); //Window
// refers to parent this

const profile={
    name:'ch',
    print:function(){
        const fav='js'
        return ()=>{
            console.log(this,this.fav);
        }
    }
}
profile.print()();

//{
name: "ch",
print:f()
},js
```

# Quick Notes
1. Method-this refers to object in which method is called
2. Simple function call -Window Strict mode-undefined
3. Event Listener-DOM element in which handler is attached to
4. Arrow function-does not get its own this.It uses lexical(parent scope of this)
5. Global context- Window object
